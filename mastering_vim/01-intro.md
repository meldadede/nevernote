# Introduction

This notes belong to Mastering Vim tutorial by Damian Conway.

Vim have thousand of commands and different key combinations. I cant learn
all of them but I can learn enough of them to make my life easier.

Trying to learn all of the commands is a wrong learning way for vim.
First try to learn things that provide immediate feedback in default text workflow.

`Vimrc`is vim runtime configuration.

Damian Conways' [vimrc](https://github.com/thoughtstream/Damian-Conway-s-Vim-Setup) setup as a reference

Best way to learn vim is using it!!!
