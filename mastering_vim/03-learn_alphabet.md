# Learn Alphabet

Vim is one character editor which means every character on the keyboard generally does
something. `a` for appending, `d` for deleting, `i` for inserting etc.

In order to improve vim knowledge you need to download some of the commands to
you fingers.

* Look at the keyboard and try to guess what character does in Vim
* If you don't know check help page related to that topics or character
* There is no point in learning the ones that you are not gonna use.
* If you dont know majority of them, notes 3-4 of them each week and use them.

> Reading help page is not the most attractive job in the world I know, may be
searching for online tips should be more pleasant job.

For the full index for both `normal` mode and `insert` mode commands

    :help normal-index
    :help insert-index
